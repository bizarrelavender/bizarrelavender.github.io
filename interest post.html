      <p class="lead"><p>Hello everyone!</p>

      <p>I hope your weekend is going well! I wanted to make sure that everyone got the info that we talked about at the general interest meeting.</p>

      <p>If you would like for your avatar to be added to the member page use this, http://www.faceyourmanga.com/, Avatar designer and send the PNG file to meat tamaralr@live.unc.edu.</p>

      <p>We will be going to see My Hero Academia: Two Heroes at the AMC Southpoint 17 on Saturday, September 29th at 7:30pm. Please fill out the form found here, https://goo.gl/forms/U4iX1mdc9II4Hkc42, if you would like to see the movie. You can also select if you would like to go out to eat before or after the movie. The form will close after the meeting on September 25th.</p>

      <p>If you have any suggestions for events, convention trips, or anything at all, you can send them using this form, https://goo.gl/forms/81fZpNJIWlnh9q223. Either me or Rachel will get back to you. This is an anonymous way to send suggestions, and no one else other than me or Rachel will see them.</p>

      <p>Meetings will start on Tuesday, September 11th at 7pm. I will send the date this Thursday after I am able to reserve rooms.</p>

      <p>If you would like to be added to the regular COUp listserv, you can contact me or Rachel, rachelju@email.unc.edu. This listserv will become inactive starting in October, so if you still want to be updated youâ€™ll have to be added to the regular listserv. The regular listserv, our Facebook group, The COUp Table, & this website are the best ways to stay in touch with the club. Heel Life will not be regularly updated, but you can still request to be added to the roster officially.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact either me or Rachel.</p> <p>Hope you enjoy the long weekend!</p>
