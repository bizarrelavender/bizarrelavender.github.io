CAROLINA OTAKU UPRISING</h1>
      <p class="lead"><p>We, the members of the Carolina Otaku Uprising, call upon all anime fans of good heart and liberated conciousness to rise up alongside their revolutionary brethren. Only by joining together arm in arm can we march forward into the future! However, a revolution does not happen overnight and there are many steps required along the way:</p>

      <p>– All members must congretate weekly at 7pm for revolutionary education. There we will watch animated propaganda from the production cadres of the island nation of Japan. We will strive to screen an ideologically correct collection of films and television broadcasts from Japan both new and old, serialized and stand alone. There are also breaks for fellowship, discussion, and self-criticism.</p>

      <p>– We also place great emphasis on cultural education and physical improvement via sporting events. Semi-regular outings to local palaces of otaku culture, cinemas, carnivore preserves, ommissaries, and bowling alleys are attended by cheerful COUP members.</p>

      <p>– Our annual milestone calendar features regular events and holidays to be celebrated by all otaku, such as annual holiday gathering in December, the spring picnic to be observed each year when the cherry blossoms bloom, and May Day are all important opportunites for commrades to celebrate together. In addition, we proudly attend the annual Animazement People’s Congress in Raleigh, NC, where we bring COUP’s stated goal of perpetual otaku revolution to the masses.</p>

      <p>Only by joining together with your fellow otaku can we liberate anime fandom in the Triangle from it’s shackles of oppression. Otaku of Chapel Hill, unite! You have nothing to loose but your chains! Party! Join us!</p>
